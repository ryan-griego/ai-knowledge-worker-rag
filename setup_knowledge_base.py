This knowledge base contains information about {base_name} and can be used with the Knowledge Worker RAG application.

## Structure

The knowledge base is organized into the following categories:

- **company/**: Company information, about us, overview
- **products/**: Product descriptions, features, pricing
- **employees/**: Employee information, contact details, responsibilities
- **contracts/**: Contract details, terms, client information
- **policies/**: Company policies and procedures
- **procedures/**: Step-by-step procedures and workflows

## Usage

1. Replace the example content with your actual information
2. Add more documents as needed
3. Organize documents into appropriate subdirectories
4. Use the Knowledge Worker application to query this knowledge base

## File Format

All documents should be in Markdown (.md) format for best compatibility with the Knowledge Worker application.

## Customization

Feel free to:
- Rename subdirectories to match your organization
- Add new subdirectories for additional categories
- Modify the document structure to fit your needs
- Add more example documents

## Getting Started

1. Edit the example files with your actual content
2. Add your own documents to the appropriate folders
3. Run the Knowledge Worker application pointing to this knowledge base:
   ```bash
   python knowledge_worker.py --knowledge-base knowledge-base-{base_name}
   ```
